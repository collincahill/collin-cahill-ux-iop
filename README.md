# UX Intern Onboarding Project: Collin Cahill

## Description
A UX project to get me up to speed on necessary skills and technologies I will be using on the UX team.

## How to Use
Please run an HTTP server (I use the npm package http-server) out of the root of this project to view it properly.
Links are currently absolute and will only link properly from a server.

## Dependencies
No dependencies yet! Honestly I don't know what the project is at this point. It's anybody's guess.

## Standards Met (Unit 2)
- declare a lang attribute in the root element
- declare a charset meta attribute in the head tag
- follow semantic markup on each page
