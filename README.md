# UX Intern Onboarding Project: Collin Cahill

## Description
A UX project to get me up to speed on necessary skills and technologies I will be using on the UX team.

## How to Use
(unit 2) Currently runs using the file system and the browser, but will run the same on a server. Just open one of the .html files and you're in.

## Dependencies
- The stylesheet imports a font from Google Fonts (Source Sans Pro).

## Standards Met (Unit 2)
- declare a lang attribute in the root element
- declare a charset meta attribute in the head tag
- follow semantic markup on each page
- data stored in tables
- accessibility measures for submission forms

## Notes
### Unit 2
- I added a viewport meta attribute to the head of each page. This is something I've learned using Google's Page Insights that has helped my responsive pages load better on mobile.
- All pages are dummy pages. No functionality, just markup and styling. Submit buttons don't work.
